## About Me
  My path is all about curiosity and continuous learning. I started as an English Teacher, which developed my communication skills and my ability to simplify complex ideas—perfect preparation for data work!

  That curiosity led me to Data Science and Machine Learning (ML). After specialized training (TripleTen, A2 Capacitación, Domestika), I quickly moved into analytics and data decision-making.

  Currently, I'm applying this knowledge at Ferretería La Providencia, focusing on inventory efficiency. My most impactful project recently involved developing and deploying an ML prediction model based on LGBMRegression.

  With one year of formal experience, I strongly believe that data and ML models are the core tools for solving modern economic challenges. I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of Economics, AI, and Data Analysis—always aiming to      turn data into strategic value.
